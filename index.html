                <p>I thought about what would be fun to try and make that would also help me learn more about frontend development
                    as I do it. So I came up with an idea that I would try to make a tic tac toe game using a grid and a bit of javascript. 
                    After I had done that I needed to still make something using a flexbox and thought it would be logical to make a contact page.

            <div class="about-contacts">
                <h3 class="text-secondary">Contact page</h3>
                <p>On the contact page you can find the relevant info to contact me about this project.</p>

            <div class="about-tic-tac-toe">
                <h3 class="text-secondary">Tic Tac Toe</h3>
                <p>For the game the original idea was to code some ai to play against you but then I remembered that this is a frontend course and I shouldn't 
                    use too much time on the logic of the game so I scrapped the idea. I might still make the ai some other day.
